# University Notes

My notes from my time in ULFG. These notes are mostly just the most important bits of each course with all the "fluff" and concepts that are not really included in exams or practical problems. A few courses here are missing since I haven't had time to properly understand the course or there exists better notes out there. I hope these notes help.
